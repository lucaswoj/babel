# Babel puts a soft cushion between a web application and the many cool new 
# file formats developed for use with node.js such as CoffeeScript, SASS, and 
# Jade. With Babel, you will be able to seamlessly load from many different 
# types of files without having to worry about the many APIs involved.

	# `callback( err, template )`. The template will be put into a function as
	# `render(locals)`, where `locals` is an object to serve as the local 
	# scope of the template during rendering. The context of the template can 
	# also be easily changed also by calling `render.call(context, locals)`

	# scope of the script during execution. The context of the script can
